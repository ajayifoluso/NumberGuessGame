# NumberGuessGame

DevOps Project: Automated Deployment of a Java Web Application

Objective

Your team is tasked with developing and deploying a fully automated pipeline for a Java-based web
application. This project will challenge you to think critically about software delivery, infrastructure
setup, and automation best practices.

**#Requirements & Expectations**
- You will work in groups of four.
- Your solution must enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for a
Java-based web application.
- Your repository structure and workflow must support collaboration and best DevOps practices.
- You will present your project as a team, ensuring each member contributes to the final delivery.
- The Jenkins pipeline must be built as a script or using Pipeline from SCM.
  
**Key Considerations**
- How will you ensure code quality and maintainability?
- How will you automate the testing and deployment process?
- How can you set up event-driven triggers to make your pipeline efficient?
- What measures will you put in place for error handling and debugging?
- How will you monitor the deployed application and ensure reliability?

**Code Files**
The required source code files will be shared via Slack. Ensure you download them and organize
your project following the directory structure shown above.

**Demonstration Guidelines**
- Code Walkthrough: Show and explain your repository structure, application logic, and configuration
files.
- Pipeline Execution: Demonstrate your automated build, test, and deployment pipeline in Jenkins.
- Deployment Showcase: Access the running application and verify its functionality.
- Lessons Learned: Each team member must share insights, challenges, and key takeaways.

**Latest Update**: Fixed compilation issues by separating test code from main servlet implementation.
